This is a simple tool to manage Hyprland workspaces alongside multi-monitor
layout, with the intent to work on multiple setup. This is provided as is, under
the MIT license, so please do whatever you want with it.

As this is a personal project to test and learn things (mainly Eio and sockets,
and interacting with Hyprland for now), don't expect too much support :) (but
you can ask anyway!)
